Summarize this for a second-grade student:

Black-on-black ware is a 20th- and 21st-century pottery tradition developed by the Puebloan Native American ceramic artists in Northern New Mexico. Traditional reduction-fired blackware has been made for centuries by pueblo artists. Black-on-black ware of the past century is produced with a smooth surface, with the designs applied through selective burnishing or the application of refractory slip. Another style involves carving or incising designs and selectively polishing the raised areas. For generations several families from Kha'po Owingeh and P'ohwhóge Owingeh pueblos have been making black-on-black ware with the techniques passed down from matriarch potters. Artists from other pueblos have also produced black-on-black ware. Several contemporary artists have created works honoring the pottery of their ancestors.

How can you develop a strong mind-heart-body connection to perform your best?

You likely spend months training for your next race by increasing distance and time running. What psychological factors can you cultivate to perform your best and increase you sense of well-being?

Optimism is a sense of hopefulness and confidence that things will work out well in the future and anticipating the best possible outcomes. Optimism is associated with more physical activity and other healthy behaviors (not smoking, healthy food choices, better sleep quality and higher heart health scores). Women with higher optimism had slower progress of plaque buildup in their arteries. Research shows that higher levels of optimism were associated with 35% decreased risk of cardiovascular disease events.  An optimistic mindset can help you reduce your risk of heart disease and reach your fitness goals.

Strategies to boost optimism: take negativity breaks and reframe with positive self-talk and imagine your “best self” and “best performance.”
